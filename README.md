 # About Me

 ## My Interests
 
In my spare time, I especially enjoy playing basketball. As a former student at NC State, I have access to the campus gym through the Alumni Association by paying a monthly fee.
Academically, Iâ€™m focused on developing strong skills in data analysis, business strategy, and financial modeling. After completing my studies, I aim to work in a Financial Planning & Analysis (FP&A) role.

 ## websites I recommend
 - [Undemy](https://www.udemy.com/home/my-courses/learning/)
  I used to purchase and subscribe to a variety of courses related to my profession, including accounting, taxation, and finance.

- [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com)
  This is a website I use almost every time I need to make a purchase. I really appreciate their Prime membership service, which usually delivers items within 48 hours.
